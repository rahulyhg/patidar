<h1>Welcome to your Freshy 2 themed <i><?php echo CHtml::encode(Yii::app()->name); ?></i></h1>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Freshy2 Yii Theme.</p>

<p>Check out the style-sheets for ideas of how to use this awesome theme, originally developed for Wordpress by <a href="http://www.jide.fr/english/downloads/freshy2">Jid√©</a>.</p>

<p>The theme features several different styles, so edit themes/freshy2/layouts/main.php to make it use a different style than the default.<br/>
The styles all bear the name of custom_<i>stylename</i>.css </p>

<p>Beware that you need to adjust any Gii-generated views and layouts, because the theme does not use Blueprint.</p>

<p>You might want to customize the sidebar menu widget - it should take advantage of what Freshy2 offers. That's left as an exercise for you. :)</p>
